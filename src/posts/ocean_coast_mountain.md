In 2022, I went on a trip through Scotland with my family.
I wasn't in a great place at the time, which made it very easy to write poetry.

Usually when I write, there's a great deal of rewriting and editing involved in order to arive at a final product that you're happy with.
So it was a plesant surprise that these three poems seemed to emerge, fully formed.

Each poem is inspired by a different landscape. I imagine it as a journey, begun out at sea and heading inland.

If you get the itch.io version, you can also hear me read them out. There's a preview of the first poem read out available [here](https://youtu.be/13So6UjJBm0?si=rsjeyvdfUnaXg9xI).
