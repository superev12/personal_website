I'm proud to announce a sight-reading training app I've been working on, called _NoteTamer_!

## Support
### Frequently Asked Questions
> Can I play melody scores in NoteTamer?

NoteTamer currently only supports rhythm scores, but we're working on supporting melody scores as well.

> How do I change the score settings?

You can change score settings such as:
- The tempo
- The duration of notes in the score
- The length of the score

by starting a 'Custom' game, then going to the 'Music' section under 'Custom Settings'.

> Help! The metronome sometimes sounds out of time.

This is a performance issue that can happen if you're running on an older, less powerful device. Your device is struggling to keep up with rendering music and playing the metronome at the same time.

In the future, we'll try and improve the performance so you don't run into this as often, but in the meantime, you can aleviate the issue by closing background tasks or running the app on a more powerful device.

> Can I change the time signature?

Only 4/4 is currently supported, but in the future we'd love to make time signature customisable.

> What's the disabled "Start Quest" button do?

The 'Quest' is a planned future mode for NoteTamer that would teach reading score notation from absolute beginner level.
