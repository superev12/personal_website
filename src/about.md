Born in Adelaide, South Australia, I grew up between Bristol and Cambridge, then studied a MEng in Computer Science at the University of York. I'm now based in Kingston-on-Hull, working as a software engineer.

I've been part of lots of software teams in different sectors, such as [ARM](https://www.arm.com), Eight19, [Emberion](https://www.emberion.com), [Rapita](https://www.rapitasystems.com), [Genomics](https://www.genomics.com), Premium Lithium, [Songbook Systems](https://www.songbook-pro.com), and my current job at [Open Science Tools](https://opensciencetools.org/), where I'm working on software to support psychologists creating reproducable studies.

I'm particularly interested in Music Software and how it can better suit the needs of musicians. I've worked with [Lore Lixenberg](https://www.lorelixenberg.art), [Tom Collins](https://www.tomcollinsresearch.net/), and Matthew Hall to create custom music software for performances. I'm also interested in the broader way that software affects the sort of music that we make, particularly regarding tuning, microtonality, and non-western temperaments.

I'm also a committed follower of Jesus, and help coordinate the music at my church in Hull.
